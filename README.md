### USES

## I use Alacritty as my terminal. I used to use iTerm2, but it became inefficient and clunky. My theme for Alacritty is Catppuccin-Mocha.

# -zsh config
* Powerlevel10k

## Terminal Packages ( all were installed via Homebrew )
* vim
* nvim
* htop
* cmatrix
* tetris
* asciiquarium
* toilet
* fortune
* cava ( rarely, audio visualizer )
* pipes.sh
* neofetch
* nerdfetch
* figlet
* cowsay
* wtf
* eza
* cbonsai

## Vim Plugins
* vim-plug
* NERDTree
* goyo
* vim-transparent
* vimwiki

## Browsers

# I have (mostly) always used Gecko based browsers such as Firefox. I now use LibreWolf as my main browser. Here are my extensions that I have :

* uBlock Origin
* Dark Reader
* LibRedirect
* Proton Pass
* SponsorBlock
* Dictionariez
* uBlacklist

# Below are the perfunctory extensions I have : 

* ClearURLS
* Fast Forward
* Indie Wiki Buddy
* Better Youtube Captions
* Return Youtube Dislike
* Youtube Redux
* Scratch Addons
* nightTab (formerly)
  
# Browsers that I also use are :

* Arc ( Even though it's not open source { and possibly insecure }, I still use it as my alternate chromium-based browser. )
* Firefox ( ofc i do )
* Vivaldi ( RSS )
* Tor ( Well, uh... )
# The rest are superficial.

## Apps

# Apps I commonly use are :
* Alacritty ( Terminal Emulator )
* LibreWolf ( Browsing )
* Signal ( Messaging )
* Raycast ( Application Searcher )
* ColorSlurp ( Color Picker )
* Notion Calendar ( Notion Calendar )
* krita ( Art )
* Terraria
* Lunar Client
* Orbot
# The rest are trivial. I strongly recommend to use krita as a paint tool as it is open source and easy to use.

## Websites I use
* inv.nadeko.net ( Youtube )
* youtube.com ( Of course I do! )
* mail.proton.me ( Mail )
* redlib.perennialte.ch ( Reddit )
* wikipedia.org ( ...Duh! )
* deepl.com ( Translation )
* nitter.poast.org ( Twitter )
* blank.page ( rarely )
* alternativeto.net ( i take this for granted )
* monkeytype.com ( Typing )
  
# The rest are... One dimensional?

## Specs and other uses
# Welp, finally, We're into the territory of specs. Make sure not to fall asleep.
* I am currently running macOS 15.0.1. Despite its flaws, it still remains a great operating system, especially with them improving their chips. One of my main flaws is that Apple produces propietary software.
* yabai is my auto window tiling manager. It's extremely efficient and customizable.
* I use an extremely simplified version of Sketchybar. Even thought it lacks a lot of the default menu bars functionality, it gets the job done in looking better than the default. I wouldn't recommend Bartender ( or any of the apps in the SetApp bundle ) because it's propietary and it's costly.
* I bought my 2021 model 14 inch M1 Pro chip Macbook Pro in late 2022, when I formerly used an extremely trashy Lenovo laptop, completely ditching Windows.
* I use Homebrew to install my apps.
* I use zsh 5.9.
* I use a Samsung A13. I will later switch to a Google Pixel to install GrapheneOS on it.
# Glad that's over...
