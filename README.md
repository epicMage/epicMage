# USES

## I use Alacritty as my terminal. I formerly to use iTerm2, but it became inefficient and clunky (especially after https://alternativeto.net/news/2025/1/iterm2-fixes-critical-ssh-security-flaw-and-urges-users-to-update-immediately-to-v3-5-11/). My theme for Alacritty is Catppuccin-Mocha.

### -zsh config
* Powerlevel10k

### Terminal Packages ( all were installed via Homebrew )
* vim
* nvim
* htop
* cmatrix
* tetris
* asciiquarium
* toilet
* fortune
* cava ( rarely, audio visualizer )
* pipes.sh
* neofetch
* nerdfetch
* figlet
* cowsay
* wtf
* eza
* cbonsai
* btop
* lua

### Rice
* JankyBorders
* Yabai
* Sketchybar ( menu bar )
* Spacebar ( other bottom bar )

### Vim Plugins
* vim-plug
* NERDTree
* goyo
* vim-transparent
* vimwiki

# Browsers

### I have (mostly) always used Gecko based browsers such as Firefox. I now use LibreWolf as my main browser. Here are my extensions that I have :

* uBlock Origin
* Dark Reader
* LibRedirect
* Proton Pass
* SponsorBlock
* Dictionariez
* uBlacklist
* ClearURLs

### Below are the perfunctory extensions I have : 

* Indie Wiki Buddy
* FastForward
* Better Youtube Captions
* Return Youtube Dislike
* Youtube Redux
* Scratch Addons
* automaticDark
* nightTab (formerly)
  
### Browsers that I also use are :

* Arc ( Even though it's not open source { and possibly insecure }, I still use it as my alternate chromium-based browser. )
* Firefox ( ofc i do )
* Vivaldi
* Tor ( Well, uh... )
* Zen ( garbage after their rebranding )
* Chromium ( Using Chrome... But private. It just works.)
* Brave

### I use formerly used Eric Murphy's custom UserChrome configuration for Librewolf. Now I currently use a TUI theme for Librewolf.

### The rest are superficial.

## Apps

### Apps I commonly use are :
* Alacritty ( Terminal Emulator )
* Iterm2 ( formerly, used for cava )
* LibreWolf ( Browsing )
* Signal ( Messaging )
* Raycast ( Application Searcher )
* ColorSlurp ( Color Picker )
* Notion Calendar ( Notion Calendar )
* krita ( Art )
* Lunar Client/Minecraft ( Minecraft )
* Orbot ( VPN )

### The rest are trivial. I strongly recommend to use krita as a paint tool as it is open source, customizable, and easy to use.

### Search Engine : SearXNG ( searx.be ). I use SearXNG because it's Libre and FOSS and respects user privacy unlike other search engines. I have privacy concerns with DuckDuckGo and it's also bloated for no reason. It also has a terrible base of Bing.

# Websites I use
* inv.nadeko.net ( Youtube frontend )
* www.youtube.com ( Of course I do! )
* mail.proton.me ( Mail )
* redlib.perennialte.ch ( Reddit frontend, R.I.P safereddit and teddit. )
* wikipedia.org ( ...Duh! )
* deepl.com ( Translation )
* nitter.poast.org ( Twitter )
* alternativeto.net ( i take this for granted )
* monkeytype.com ( Typing )
  
## The rest are... One dimensional?

## Specs and other uses
### Welp, finally, We're into the territory of specs. Make sure not to fall asleep.
* I am currently running macOS 15.0.1, despite its flaws. macOS still remains a great operating system, especially with them improving their chips. { TANGENT : One of my main flaws is that Apple produces propietary software, and how it's bloated as hell. }
* yabai is my auto window tiling manager. It just works.
* I use an extremely simplified version of Sketchybar. Even thought it lacks a lot of the default menu bars functionality, it gets the job done in looking better than the default. { TANGENT : I wouldn't recommend Bartender ( or any of the apps in the SetApp bundle ) because it's propietary and it's subscription based. }
* I bought my 2021 model 14 inch M1 Pro chip Macbook Pro in extremely late 2022, when I formerly used an extremely trashy Lenovo laptop, completely ditching Windows.
* I use Homebrew to install terminal apps and other applications.
* I use zsh. tmux is too confusing.
* Google Pixel 8a without SIM running GrapheneOS, along with a cheap samsung A13.
## Glad that's over...
