## Terminal

* I use Alacritty as my terminal. I formerly used iTerm2, but it became inefficient, clunky, [and insecure](https://alternativeto.net/news/2025/1/iterm2-fixes-critical-ssh-security-flaw-and-urges-users-to-update-immediately-to-v3-5-11/). My theme for Alacritty is Catppuccin-Mocha.

## Terminal Packages ( most were installed via Homebrew )
* vim
* nvim
* htop
* cmatrix
* tetris
* asciiquarium
* toilet
* fortune
* cava ( rarely, audio visualizer )
* pipes.sh
* neofetch
* nerdfetch
* figlet
* cowsay
* wtf
* eza
* cbonsai
* btop
* lua
* Ollama
* lolcat

## Rice
* JankyBorders
* Yabai
* Sketchybar ( menu bar )

## Vim Plugins

* AstroNvim

## Browsers

**I have (mostly) always used Gecko based browsers such as Firefox. I use LibreWolf as my main browser. Here are the extensions that I have**

* uBlock Origin
* LibRedirect
* Proton Pass
* SponsorBlock
* Dictionariez
* uBlacklist
* ClearURLs
* Vimium
---

Below are the perfunctory extensions I have : 

* Indie Wiki Buddy
* FastForward
* Better Youtube Captions
* Return Youtube Dislike
* Youtube Redux
* Scratch Addons
* automaticDark
  
### Browsers that I also use are :

* Arc ( formerly as an alternative chromium browser )
* Brave ( secondary chromium browser )
* Firefox ( Duh! )
* Vivaldi
* Chromium
---
The rest are superficial.

## Apps

* [Alacritty](Alacritty.org) ( Terminal Emulator )
* [Signal](signal.org) ( Messaging )
* [Raycast](raycast.com)
* ~~ColorSlurp~~ [Color Picker](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker)
* [krita](krita.org) ( Art )
* [Lunar Client](lunarclient.com)/[Minecraft](minecraft.net)
* [Mullvad VPN](mullvad.net)
* [FreeTube](freetubeapp.io)
---
* The rest are trivial. I strongly recommend to use krita as a paint tool as it is FLOSS, highly customizable, and easy to use.

## Search Engine
I use my localhosted SearXNG instance. I use SearXNG because it's FLOSS and respects user privacy unlike other search engines. I have privacy concerns with DuckDuckGo and it's also bloated. It also scrapes its results off of bing.
## Websites I use
~~* inv.nadeko.net ( Youtube frontend )~~
* mail.proton.me ( Mail )
* wikipedia.org ( ...Duh! )
* deepl.com ( Translation )
* nitter.poast.org ( Twitter )
* alternativeto.net ( i take this for granted )
* monkeytype.com ( Typing )
---

The rest are... One dimensional?

## Specs and other uses
**Welp, finally, We're into the territory of specs. Make sure not to fall asleep.**
* I am currently running macOS 15.0.1, despite its flaws. macOS still remains a pretty good operating system, especially with them improving their chips. Though MacOS does not respect user freedom and user repair, I continue to use it.
* yabai is my auto window tiling manager. It just works.
* I use an extremely simplified version of Sketchybar. Even thought it lacks a lot of the default menu bars functionality, it gets the job done in looking better than the default.
* I bought my 2021 model 14 inch M1 Pro chip Macbook Pro in extremely late 2022, when I formerly used an extremely trashy Lenovo laptop, completely ditching Windows.
* I use Homebrew to install terminal apps and other applications.
* I use zsh. tmux is too confusing.
* Google Pixel 8a without SIM running GrapheneOS, along with a cheap samsung A13.
