## Terminal

* I use Alacritty as my terminal. I formerly used iTerm2 (on my mac), but it became inefficient, clunky, [and insecure](https://alternativeto.net/news/2025/1/iterm2-fixes-critical-ssh-security-flaw-and-urges-users-to-update-immediately-to-v3-5-11/). My theme for Alacritty is Catppuccin-Mocha.

* I use zsh as my shell.

## Terminal Packages ( most were installed via Homebrew  & yay/pacman )
* vim
* nvim
* lvim (lunarvim)
* cmatrix
* vitetris
* asciiquarium
* fortune
* cava
* pipes.sh
* neofetch
* nerdfetch
* figlet
* cowsay
* wtf
* eza
* cbonsai
* btop
* ollama (mac)
* lolcat

## Rice
### MacOS
* JankyBorders
* Yabai
* Sketchybar ( menu bar for macos )
### Arch Linux
* My waybar config that I'm proud of
* Hyprland and other hypr utilities

## Browsers

**I have (mostly) always used Gecko based browsers such as Firefox. I use LibreWolf as my main browser. Here are the main extensions that I have**

* uBlock Origin
* LibRedirect
* Proton Pass
* SponsorBlock
* Dictionariez (must need extension)
* ClearURLs
---

Below are the small little extensions I have : 

* Indie Wiki Buddy
* FastForward
  
### Browsers that I also use are :
#### MacOS
* Arc ( formerly as an alternative chromium browser )
* Vivaldi
* Firefox ( Duh! )
* Chromium
#### MacOS & Linux
* Brave ( secondary chromium browser )
---
The rest are superficial.

## Apps

* [Alacritty](Alacritty.org) ( Terminal Emulator )
* [Signal](signal.org) ( Messaging )
* [Raycast](raycast.com)
* ~~ColorSlurp~~ [Color Picker](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker)
* [krita](krita.org) ( Art )
* [Lunar Client](lunarclient.com)/[Minecraft](minecraft.net)
* [Mullvad VPN](mullvad.net)
* [FreeTube](freetubeapp.io)
---
* The rest are trivial. I strongly recommend to use krita as a paint tool as it is FLOSS, highly customizable, and easy to use. (haha krita's still better than gimp 3.0)

## Search Engine
I use my localhosted SearXNG instance on my Mac (because better ram) and seek.fyi (the most vanilla searxng instance i've found so far) I use SearXNG because it's FLOSS and respects user privacy unlike other search engines.
## Websites I use
* mail.proton.me ( Mail )
* wikipedia.org
* deepl.com ( Translation )
* nitter.poast.org ( Twitter )
* alternativeto.net ( i take this for granted )
---

The rest are... One dimensional?

## Specs and other uses
**Welp, finally, We're into the territory of specs. Make sure not to fall asleep.**
* I am currently running macOS 15.0.1 (i hate apple ai, never upgrading to 15.1) and a crappy Thinkpad T490 running Arch I got for free, despite their flaws. macOS still remains a pretty good operating system, especially with them improving their chips. It also has app compatibility I can't find on Linux.
* yabai is my auto window tiling manager for MacOS. It just works.
* I use Hyprland & KDE Plasma on my Thinkpad.
* I use an extremely simplified version of Sketchybar on my Mac. Even thought it lacks a lot of the default menu bars functionality, it gets the job done in looking better than the default.
* I bought my 2021 model 14 inch M1 Pro chip Macbook Pro in extremely late 2022, when I formerly used an extremely trashy Lenovo laptop, completely ditching Windows.
* I use Homebrew to install terminal apps and other applications.
* I use zsh. Sometimes I organize my zsh w/ tmux. Doesn't work on Mac for some reason.
* Google Pixel 8a running GrapheneOS, along with a cheap samsung A13.
